### A practice space for my research colleages to learn Git, version control, and DVC using Python, R, and R studio

#### Data Version Control 
- https://dvc.org
- DVC creates hash files to track version changes in large data files
- Useful because GitHub limits individual filesize to ~100mb, unless you upgrade to GitHub large file storage
